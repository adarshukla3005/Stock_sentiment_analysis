## How to Use 
### Clone the repository:
```
git clone (https://github.com/adarshukla3005/Stock_sentiment_analysis.git)
```

When this script will run, it will read the test images from './test/low/' and produce the corresponding outputs in './test/predicted/' . We should run python 'main.py' in the final submitted code.
